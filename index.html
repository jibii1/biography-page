</p><b>POEM</b><br>

<p><i>In the dance of life, I find my stride,<br>
Through valleys low and mountains wide.<br>
With words as my guide, I journey on,<br>
Seeking truth till the break of dawn.<br>
<br>
In dreams I wander, in ink I write,<br>

Each verse a star in the endless night.<br>

For stories whispered in the wind's embrace,<br>

Leave echoes of wonder, time cannot erase.<br>

<br>
So here I stand, a poet true,<br>

Ink-stained fingers, heart renewed.<br>

For in the pages of my life's grand tale,<br>

I find my voice, and thus prevail.<br>
